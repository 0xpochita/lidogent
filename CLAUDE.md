## Security Rules

- NEVER commit or push files containing secrets, API keys, private keys, or tokens (.env, credentials.json, keystore files, etc.)
- NEVER log, print, or echo secrets in terminal output
- NEVER hardcode private keys, mnemonics, or API keys in source code
- NEVER include MEMORY.md in commits (already in .gitignore)
- Always verify .gitignore covers sensitive files before committing
- If a user pastes a private key or mnemonic, stop them immediately and warn them

## Git Rules

- Always review `git status` and `git diff` before committing
- Never use `git add -A` or `git add .` without checking for sensitive files first
- Never force push without user confirmation
- Never commit node_modules, .next, or build artifacts

## Smart Contract Rules

- Never deploy contracts with hardcoded private keys
- Always use environment variables for RPC URLs and deployer keys
- Verify contract addresses before interacting — never hallucinate addresses
- Use SafeERC20 for token interactions
- Be aware that USDC has 6 decimals, not 18

## Project Context

- Monorepo: `frontend/` (Next.js) and `contracts/` (Solidity/Foundry)
- Track: stETH Agent Treasury (Lido Labs Foundation)
- Network: Holesky testnet for development, mainnet for production
