### Testing & QA
- Tested stake/wrap flows on Ethereum Mainnet with real ETH
- Identified bugs: stuck "Confirming...", balance not showing, NotOwner revert

- Tested AI chat and identified model ID errors
- Verified whitelist functionality onchain via Etherscan

### Infrastructure
- Set up GitHub repository (0xpochita/lidogent)

### Architecture & Integration
- Designed monorepo structure (frontend/ + contracts/)
- Created full ABI for AgentTreasury (30+ functions)
- Built 10+ custom hooks (useTreasuryRead, useSpend, useEthPrice, useLidoApr, etc.)

- Managed all contract address updates across codebase
- Created SKILL.md for agent skill documentation

### Design System
- Implemented blue+white minimalist theme
- Set up Tailwind CSS 4 with custom tokens
- Integrated Inter font, framer-motion animations
- Created consistent component library (cards, modals, tooltips, steppers)
- Added real brand logos (stETH, wstETH, LDO, ETH, Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity)

### Documentation
- Created brainstorm/brainstorm.md (EN + ID)
- Created brainstorm/overview.md — full project architecture
- Created brainstorm/flow.md — 11-step user flow

## How We Worked Together

The human provided strategic direction, design decisions, and real-world testing. The agent handled all implementation — code, architecture, documentation, and integration. Every feature was a back-and-forth: human specified what to build, agent built it, human tested and refined, agent iterated.

Key collaborative moments:
1. **Track selection** — Agent presented 35 options, human chose stETH Agent Treasury
2. **Design pivot** — Human changed theme from pink to blue after seeing initial UI
3. **Contract bug** — Human discovered onlyOwner deposit issue during testing, agent fixed and redeployed
4. **Wrap flow** — Agent read Lido docs to implement correct 4-step flow after human pointed out the issue
5. **Free tier decision** — Human decided to use Gemini free tier for demo instead of paid models
6. **Security** — Human requested RPC proxy to hide Alchemy key, agent implemented server-side proxy
7. **Gas fee problem** — Human flagged high gas cost, agent designed hybrid yield-verification approach (no gas needed)
8. **CLI demo** — Human requested terminal demo for video, agent built two scripts for demo and real onchain spend
