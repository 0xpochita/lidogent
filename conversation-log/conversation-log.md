- First address: `0xf5b4B061c2A28dfF834b1C1648E0D05120529c81`
- Created brainstorm/contract-address.md

### Commit: `e7fb23a` — docs: add contract address overview

---

## Session 16 — Full Contract Integration & API Proxy (2026-03-18)

### Contract Integration
- `config/contracts.ts`: Full ABI for AgentTreasury (30+ functions), ERC20, wstETH
- `hooks/use-treasury.ts`: 10 hooks covering all contract operations
- `hooks/use-lido.ts`: Hooks for wstETH conversion rates

### Stake Form — Direct Lido Integration
- Calls `Lido.submit()` at `0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84`
- Real ETH balance, MAX button, transaction confirmation

### AI Chat API Proxy

### Commit: `8ba5a3f` — feat(frontend): integrate Lido contracts, API proxy, and wagmi hooks

---

## Session 17 — Public Deposits, Wrap Flow, Stepper UX, Live Data (2026-03-18)

### Smart Contract Fix
- **Bug:** deposit functions had onlyOwner — non-deployer users couldn't deposit
- **Fix:** Removed onlyOwner from depositWstETH, depositETH, depositStETH
- **Redeployed:** `0x783e1512bFEa7C8B51A92cB150FEb5A04b91E9Aa`
- 30/30 fork tests passing

### Correct Wrap Flow (per Lido docs)
1. Approve stETH to wstETH contract (0x7f39...)
2. Call wstETH.wrap() — user receives wstETH
3. Approve wstETH to AgentTreasury (0x783e...)
4. Call AgentTreasury.depositWstETH() — lock as principal

### Stepper UX
- Button opens preview popup first (not immediate wallet)
- User sees 4 steps with logos before starting
- Click "Start Wrapping" to begin execution
- Close button in preview mode
- Steps auto-progress with pulsing indicator

### Live Treasury Data
- Treasury Overview reads from deployed contract (not mock store)
- principalWstETH, getAvailableYield(), totalSpentWstETH
- stETH balance from ERC20 hook
- Smart formatting: 6 decimals for tiny amounts, 4 for normal

### Code Quality
- Split stake-panel.tsx (871 > 486 lines)
- RPC proxy: private Alchemy key hidden behind /api/rpc

### Commit: `b5b2ace` — feat: public deposits, wrap flow, stepper UX, live treasury data

---

## Session 19 — Real Lido APR & Live Yield (2026-03-18)

### Human-Agent Collaboration
- **Human:** Asked if real APY data can be fetched from Lido Finance
- **Agent:** Found Lido API: `eth-api.lido.fi/v1/protocol/steth/apr/last` — current APR: 2.41%
- Built `/api/lido-apr` proxy with 5-minute cache + `useLidoApr()` hook
- Replaced all mock ~3.5% APY with real data
- **Human:** Requested real yield calculation instead of mock counter
- **Agent:** LiveYield now calculates `yieldPerSecond = principal * (APR/100) / secondsPerYear`
- **Human:** Asked when yield actually appears
- **Agent:** Explained yield comes from stEthPerToken() increase via Lido oracle rebase (~1x/day)

### Commit: `9c34806` — feat: real Lido APR, live yield calculation, layout polish

---

## Session 20 — Onchain ETH Price via Chainlink (2026-03-18)

## Session 31 — Agent Onchain Spend & CLI Demo (2026-03-18)

### Human-Agent Collaboration
- **Human:** Identified that AI Chat was only calling OpenRouter API without any onchain spend
- **Agent:** Built server-side agent spend system with yield verification
- **Human:** Raised concern about gas fees on mainnet for every request
- **Agent:** Implemented hybrid approach — onchain yield read (free) + offchain accounting
- **Human:** Requested CLI demo scripts for video demonstration
- **Agent:** Built two CLI scripts:

### What Was Built

#### `scripts/agent-demo.ts` — Interactive Agent CLI
- Reads treasury state from smart contract (principal, yield, permissions)
- Chats with AI (OpenRouter) — each request verified against onchain yield
- Interactive mode with `/status`, `/ledger`, `/quit` commands
- Shows APPROVED/DENIED based on real yield balance
- Payment receipt with "Principal Touched: NEVER" confirmation

#### `scripts/agent-spend.ts` — Real Onchain Spend
- Agent wallet calls `spend()` on AgentTreasury contract
- Pre-spend check: reads yield, principal, agent config from contract
- Executes transaction, waits for confirmation
- Post-spend verification: shows updated totalSpentWstETH, unchanged principal
- Outputs Etherscan link for proof

#### `/api/chat` — Server-Side Yield Verification
- Every AI chat request reads `getAvailableYield()` onchain (free, no gas)
- Tracks spending in offchain ledger with pending settlement
- Returns 402 if insufficient yield
- Refunds ledger if AI provider fails
- GET endpoint exposes ledger status

#### AI Chat Component Updates
- Shows "yield verified" badge on each AI response
- Toast notification on successful yield verification
- Activity feed shows verified status per request
- Cost per request: configurable via COST_PER_REQUEST env var

### Key Decisions
1. Hybrid onchain/offchain approach: yield verified from contract every request, settlement batched
2. Two separate CLI scripts: demo (no gas) and spend (real tx)
3. Agent wallet configurable via AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY env var
4. Cost per request default: 0.0000000001 wstETH (configurable)
